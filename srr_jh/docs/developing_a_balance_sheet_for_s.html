<body>

<p><strong>Developing a Balance Sheet for Sidewalk Rebate Program and assigning 
new applications to wait-list:</strong><br />
<br />
Assuming the Starting Balance&nbsp; =&nbsp;&nbsp; $6,000,000<br />
<br />
Count the Number of Application Received (not reviewed by BPW at this point):</p>
<p>For each application received a $2000 or $4000 will be assigned as <strong>
RESERVED_AMT</strong> to this application.<br />
<br />
Example:</p>
<p>&nbsp;24 Residential Property Applications<br />
15 Commercial Property Applications</p>
<p>&nbsp;Reserved funds = 24 x $2000 + 15 x $4000 = $108, 000<br />
<br />
Once an offer is made, an <strong>OFFERED_AMT</strong> will be assigned to each 
of those applications and the <strong>RESERVED_AMT</strong> will be set to 0.&nbsp; 
This means that any application at any point of time has either a Reserved 
Amount or Offered Amount and for "Not Eligible", "Declined", etc.&nbsp; both 
amouts will be 0.<br />
<br />
At any point of time the <strong>AVAILABLE FUND = Starting Balance - Total of 
All Reserved Amounts - Total of All Offered Amounts</strong><br />
<br />
The application OFFERED_AMT to 0 if applicant declined offer or offer expired so 
that the running total will be accurate.</p>
<p>The available funds will be calcuated each time a new application is received 
and at a certain amount, all new applications will be assigned a status of 
"Wait-Listed".</p>
<p>Another algorithm will be developed to move applications from "Wait-Listed" 
to the "Pending Review" queue whenever an application is deemed "Not Eligible", 
"Declined", etc..<br />
There could be a time gap between moving applications from "Wait-Listed" to 
"Pending Review" queue based on time allowed for appeal.</p>
